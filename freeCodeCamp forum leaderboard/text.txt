For your timeAgo function, you will want to calculate the difference between the current time and the time of the last activity on a topic. This will allow you to display how much time has passed since a topic had any activity.

Complete the timeAgo function that meets the following requirements:

    If the amount of minutes that have passed is less than 60, return the string xm ago. x will represent the minutes.
    If the amount of hours that have passed is less than 24, return the string xh ago. x will represent the hours.
    Otherwise, return the string xd ago. x will represent the days.

Here are some equations that will help you calculate the time difference:

    minutes = Math.floor((currentTime - lastPost) / 60000);
    hours = Math.floor((currentTime - lastPost) / 3600000);
    days = Math.floor((currentTime - lastPost) / 86400000);
